# test_hf_dataset

This dataset was created to document how to create an audio dataset and upload
it to HuggingFace [see GitHub repo](https://github.com/guynich/test_hf_dataset).

Next step: add more documentation.
e.g.:
* contents of the dataset
* context for how the dataset should be used, e.g.: `datasets` package
* existing dataset cards, such as the ELI5 dataset card, show common conventions
